# Robust Two-exposure Image Fusion
Implementation for robust two-exposure image fusion, CVPR 2020 (under review).

## Introduction
In this repository, we provide
* Our model architecture description (HDR_RL)
* Demo code
* Trained models
* Fusion examples

The code is based on Facebook's Torch implementation of ResNet ([facebook/fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch)). <br>


## Test models
1. Clone this github repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/bigmms/reinforcement_learning_hdr
cd reinforcement_learning_hdr
```
2. Place your own **low-resolution images** in `./test/Images` folder. (There are two sample images - baboon and comic).
3. Download pretrained models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17VYV_SoZZesU6mbxz2dMAIccSSlqLecY) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-Lh6ma-wXzfH8NqeBtPaFQ). Place the models in `./models`. We provide two models with high perceptual quality and high PSNR performance (see [model list](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN/tree/master/models)).
4. Run test. We provide ESRGAN model and RRDB_PSNR model and you can config in the `test.py`.
```
python agent_test.py
```
5. The results are in `./test/test_run/results` folder.
